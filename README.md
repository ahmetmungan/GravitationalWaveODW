# GravitationalWaveODW

It is a project covering the recent discoveries of Gravitational Waves. In this project, it includes software situations such as examining the structure of the data that led to the discovery, testing the models suitable for the data structure, the effect of astrophysical and cosmological quantities on the data, and interpreting them with computer science. The study revealed that its validation and testability is an important discovery.
